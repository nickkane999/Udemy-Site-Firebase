# Tic Tac Toe app

This was the first project to become more familar with functional components in React 

## useState syntax with props
Understanding how to save the state of variables with useState and pass it on to components as props was valuable. I got plenty of practice using it for this,
which was an important reason for creating the project

# String literals
I have used this in past projects, but incorporating it with react-specific syntax that referenced state variables was good experience

# SCSS
I've preferred using this to CSS, and glad I could import the package to have it work in a react enviornment

# eslint, prettier formatting
Learning about these formatting tools was great. It will help me produce cleaner code more quickly on future projects
