# Box Office

This was the second project to become more familar with functional components in React

## useState with useCallback, adding reducers

Controlling states within functional components was more important for this project.
useCallback let me determine when functions ran; they did not run every time the component was re-rendered. This project also let me use reducers with Lazy initialization and also with specifying the initial state. This practice and having examples to work with on future projects will be helpful

## Memo, Styled components

Adding memo to functional components let me improve the speed and functionality of my app. Styled components was a nice way of organizing CSS and incorporating props data for set CSS. This will definitely help on future projects to be more optimized and organized with my code

## Methods for structuring files

Getting an example to work with for page layout templates, components interacting with other components, and how the files are organized in folders will make it easier to organize and start my next react project
